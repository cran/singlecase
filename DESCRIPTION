Description: The singlecase package implements various functions for the single-case research in neuropsychology. Currently, the functions that are implemented were all originally developed by John Crawford, Paul Garthwaite and colleagues. These functions mainly deal with the comparison of a patient's test score (or score difference) to a control or normative sample.  These methods also provide a point estimate of the percentage of the population that would obtain a more extreme score (or score difference) and, for some problems, an accompanying interval estimate (i.e., confidence limits) on this percentage.
